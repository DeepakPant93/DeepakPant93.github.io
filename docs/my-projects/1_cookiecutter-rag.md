# Cookiecutter-RAG

## Description

A cross-platform command-line utility that creates projects for generative AI RAG application development from cookiecutters (project templates), e.g. Python package projects, C projects.

Enhanced the open-source Cookiecutter project to create a standardized structure for ML and Retrieval-Augmented Generation projects, reducing setup time by 50%.

This is a modern Cookiecutter template for initializing Python projects, particularly for General AI RAG Application Development. It provides a comprehensive setup for development, testing, and deployment, incorporating essential tools for effective project management.
